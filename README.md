# Beacon Service Demo App (iOS)

This is the demo application for the Google Proximity Beacon APIs for iOS. It
also includes a sample Eddystone scanner, which it uses to find beacons on live
devices.

### Building The Sample

Setting up this sample is mostly about getting set up with the various Google
APIs, their authentication keys, and OAuth stuff. The actual app itself is
CocoaPod based and quite easy to get running.

**FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS SUPER CAREFULLY!**

0. Make sure your computer has CocoaPods installed,
   [http://cocoapods.org](http://cocoapods.org), as well as Xcode 6 (We've
   had reports that Xcode 7 betas might be problematic at this point.)

1. To get all the component pieces.

        cd ~/the/folder/that/has/"Podfile"/in/it
        pod install
        open BeaconServiceDemoApp.xcworkspace/

	Don't try to build or run yet â€” it won't compile. We need to add a couple
  of _.plist_ files first.

	(Do NOT open the _.xcodeproj/_, only use the _.xcworkspace/_ !!)

1. Go to Google API Cloud Developer Console thingie,
   [console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com)
1. Create a new project (via the dropdown at the top). Enable the following
   APIs (on the left side, click '*APIs & auth*', then '*APIs*'):

    * Google Proximity Beacon API (*not* Proximity Pairing).
    * Google Maps SDK for iOS.
    * Google Places API for iOS.

1. On the left of the Developers Console, click on "*APIs & auth*", and then on
   "*Credentials*". Press "*Create new Key*" to create a Public API access key.
   1. Choose '*iOS Key*'.
   2. In the box where you specify acceptable bundle IDs, you can choose to
        either specify `com.google.sample.BeaconServiceDemoApp`, or just leave
        it blank (note, that for shipping apps, leaving it blank isn't a great
        idea).
   2. Click "*Create*".
   2. `Copy` *BeaconServiceDemoApp/APIKey.plist.sample* to
     *BeaconServiceDemoApp/APIKey.plist*  and replace
     `ENTER YOUR API KEY HERE` with this newly generated API key.
   2. This API key will now always be available on the running `AppDelegate`
      as `googleAPIKey`.

1. Go to [https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating)
   from a browser logged in to the account that created the API project you
   just created.

1. Go to the button "*Get a configuration file*" and click that.

1. For "*App Name*", Enter / select the project name you just created in API
   console.

1. For iOS BundleID, enter `com.google.sample.BeaconServiceDemoApp`. **IF YOU
   DO NOT ENTER EXACTLY THIS IT WILL NOT WORK**, it's case sensitive.

1. "*Continue to Choose and Configure Services*".

1. Enable Google SignIn (that's all).

1. "*Continue to Generate configuration Files*".

1. Download the configuration file, *GoogleService-Info.plist*.  Put it in the
   same folder as your Info.plist and APIKey.plist files.
   Make sure any other
   *GoogleService-Info.plist* files are deleted.

1. You now have to set your project's reversed client ID in Xcode:

   1. Click on the blue project "*BeaconServiceDemoApp*" at the top of the
        Project Navigator.
   1. Click on "*BeaconServiceDemoApp*" under "*Targets*" in the main part of
      Xcode.
   1. Click on "*Info*" across the top.
   1. Look for the scheme under "URL Types" that looks like:
        `com.googleusercontent.apps.234235235-fjboi3289ab89j4g89adsjfoasidfjs`
   1. Replace that scheme with the value of the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` from the
        GoogleService-Info.plist file
        (i.e. `com.googleusercontent.apps.2384234-35892859asdfashdoaiusdasf`)

1. (OPTIONAL, BUT *VERY* COOL). One of the best ways to make sure that
   everything is running properly is to run this app in the simulator. Since
   the simulator doesn't support Bluetooth scanning, we can, instead, have the
   app "see" some fake Eddystone devices when you click "*Scan*". To do this,
   you should run the following in your root *BeaconServiceDemoApp* folder:

       # php gen_fake_beacons.php

   Now when you build and run the simulator, there will be 10 beacons that
   you can play around with registering, activating, deactivating, etc, and
   be able to verify that everything is working properly before actually
   modifying real-world beacon hardware.


   Give it a whirl! Generate the fake beacons, build and run in the simulator.


**Phew**, we're done!
